**Human Emotion Recognition**

**Overview**
This project focuses on recognizing human emotions using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model classifies emotions based on facial expressions captured through images or video input. It aims to provide an efficient and accurate emotion detection system, which can be useful in applications like sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and mental health monitoring.

Currently, the core implementation of the model is functional, but efforts are ongoing to improve the accuracy and performance.

**Dataset**
  This project uses publicly available emotion recognition dataset, such as:
   FER-2013 - A popular dataset consisting of facial images labeled with emotion categories.
   Custom datasets can also be used with slight adjustments.
  
**Preprocessing**
  Image data is resized to a fixed size (e.g., 48x48 or 64x64 pixels).
  Data augmentation is applied to improve model robustness (e.g., horizontal flip, rotation).

**Installation**
  Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/mkleokhan/human-emotion-recognition.git
  cd human-emotion-recognition

**Install the required dependencies:**
 (pip install -r requirements.txt)
  Download and prepare the dataset. Place it in the data/ directory, or modify the paths accordingly in the code.
  
  **Usage**
  **Training the Model**
    To train the model on the dataset, use the following command:
    python train.py
    
  **Testing the Model**
      After training, test the model using:
      python test.py
      
  **Real-time Emotion Detection**
       For real-time emotion detection using a webcam:
       python detect_realtime.py

    
  **Custom Model Configurations**
  You can modify the model architecture or hyperparameters in the config.py file.

**Model Performance**
  The current version of the model achieves decent performance, but further improvements are being worked on, particularly in terms of accuracy. Current accuracy on the test dataset is around X% (update with actual value).

**Evaluation Metrics**
-  Accuracy
-  Precision
-  Recall
-  F1-Score
-  Confusion Matrix
-  Plots for loss and accuracy trends are generated during training and saved under the results/ directory.

**Challenges & Future Improvements**
  While the model is functional, here are the challenges and ongoing improvements:

  Improving Accuracy: Efforts are focused on tuning hyperparameters, improving data preprocessing, and experimenting with different model architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
  Handling Overfitting: Regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization are being incorporated to reduce overfitting.
  Expanding Emotion Categories: Future iterations will expand the model to handle more nuanced emotions.
  Real-Time Performance: Optimizations are being made to ensure smooth real-time performance with minimal lag.
